    "For my analysis, I wanted to examine the relationship that certain variables have on a houses' price. Our research question that we will be using is \"To what extent do Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Footage, and Lot Size affect Housing Prices in New York?\" Now, we are going to be using a Multiple Linear Regression model to evaluate this question, so our variable choices all need to be quantitative variables, which they are. I am choosing to only include houses in New York to try and limit the amount of external factors that could have outside influence on our model. Keeping all of our values from the same relative location allows us to, ideally, ignore the other nuances in real estate that location naturally brings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question serves many purposes. Analyzing housing prices in New York offers important insights for various stakeholders in the real estate sector. Understanding the key factors influencing housing prices not only aids buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions but also assists policymakers and urban planners in crafting effective housing policies. This analysis can identify trends, such as the impact of square footage, location, amenities, and show the combined impact that these variables have on explaining the observed variance that we see in house prices. This information allows those involved in the real estate market to optimize pricing strategies, predict market trends, and tailor their approach to investing, allowing for better-informed decisions. Also, by determining if we can use our variables to better explain the observed variances in our housing prices, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that shape the real estate market in New York, ultimately creating a more efficient and responsive housing marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis is that the model will demonstrate that our variables do in fact have a statistically significant impact on house prices. The model will further demonstrate this by explaining the observed variance we see in our data. Because of this Our Null and Alternative Hypotheses are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Null hypothesis</b> - Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Footage, and Lot Size do not have a statistically significant affect Housing Prices in New York.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \n",
    "<b>Alternate Hypothesis</b> – Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Footage, and Lot Size have a statistically significant affect Housing Prices in New York."

    "My data collection process was fairly simple. I knew that I wanted to do something relating to real estate. In debating my data collection options, I decided to first check Kaggle, a site that holds thousands of datasets free for public use. A quick search for real estate data revealed the dataset that I ultimately chose to use. It was a rather simple process, and using a publiclly availiable dataset has the largest benefit of being extremely easy to access. It was as simple as downloading the data as a CSV file and I was good to go. The one downside to using a premade dataset however, I don't have any control over the content of the data, including variables. This dataset has 10 variables, and 4 of them aren't of much use to us in this analysis. So we are left with only a handful of variables for us to use. If we had collected the data ourselves, we could of had more control over what data we collected, including variables we would ideally like to test. But since this is premade dataset, we are stuck with what we have."

Given the criteria used to filter out the outliers, we have gotten rid of our massive values that would have had a rather aggressive impact on our analysis. Also within the housing market itself, there are naturally occuring outliers present. In every housing market in the country, you are likely to find massive homes compared to the average house. We do want to be able to account for some of those, so we will leave in the remaining outliers. Note that we haven't selected our final 10,000 homes to conduct the analysis on. When we do that, we will have a random number of these values with outliers present, which will help account for more observed randomness in our data."

    "Now that we have narrowed down our 1.4 million values down to 10,000, we can discuss the advantages and disadvantages to our methods of narrowing down our data. There are two mani advantages to our methods. Firstly, by narrowing down our data, we significantly reduced the number of rows to analyze, leading to improved processing efficiency, as working with a smaller dataset often requires less computational resources and speeds up data analysis and visualization tasks. The second benefit is by selectively removing datas, we were able to filter out certain values that we didn't want to deal with, such as null values, that makes cleaning the data simpler for us.\n",
